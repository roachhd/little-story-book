#My Little Friend

One day Apple the Panda was playing with his new little friend Max the Red Panda. Max said "Can we eat sushi and apples"? 
Apple said "Yes we can", they loved them.

After eating Apple and Max played with tyres as hula-hoops. 

It was funny and fun. Apple had got bamboo to eat. Max said "This is a cool day today".

Apple said "Yes it is"!

On Tuesday Max and Apple sat on tyres as cool pandas. A girl panda, named Zoe and her friend the red Panda, named Maddy. 

They got in love.
