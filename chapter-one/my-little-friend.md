#My Little Friend

🍣 & 🍎 

---

One day Apple the Panda was playing with his new little friend Max the Red Panda. Max said "Can we eat sushi and apples"? 
Apple said "Yes we can", they loved them.

After eating Apple and Max played with tyres as hula-hoops. 

Apple had got bamboo to eat. Max said this is a cool day today.
